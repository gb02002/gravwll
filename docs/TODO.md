## Getting back on track

### Version 0.0.2

#### Milestones

##### Render

- [x] Read pipeline tutorial
- [x] Get any of our points to render
- [x] Introduce scene concept
- [x] Get camera and glm
- [x] Put everything together

10.12:
> Now we have render using static scene and camera. We must bring
  semi-final shaders(difference must be left only in terms of camera),
  and then try to figure out why each time introducing mvp-camera breaks
  everything.

- [x] bring semi-final shaders
- [x] port static camera to mvp-camera keeping same position
- [ ] make camera movable

- [x] shaders-path to root-folder

> Connect tree and vertex buffer

- [ ] idk
